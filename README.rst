COVID-19 outbreak Spain
-----------------------

This project offers a Jupyter Notebook with several interactive tools for following the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain in the beginning of the year 2020. Different mathematical models and hypotheses about the nature of the disease spread are proposed, implemented and put to test, thereby learning about the inherent behavior and mathematical nature of virus spread within social communities.

The data used used for elaborating these tools are the datasets provided by the data-based journalism project "Datadista", whichs offers normalized and pre-procesed data sets from the daily information updates provided by different spanish authorities.

The interactive tools provided are developed with the help of `plotly` via the use of graphing objects and also complete `dash` applications served by `flask`.
